Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a dscipline that involves applying of engineering principles, methods and tools systematically to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
It has a signigicant role in the technology industry as it pivots creation of systems that help power different services of the modern life such as communication, commerce and entertainment.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  Development of programming language- This is the birth of programming language and development of the languages to high level hence the rise of modern progamming languages.
 The advent of structured programming in the 1970's-  This entailed improving programing languages to be of quality, clear and maintainable.
 The rise of agile methodoligies in 2000's- This was enhancement of programming languages from been rigid to becoming more flexible.
 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements: This is the collection of user needs and requirements needed in a system.
Design: It entails creation of the software architecture fit of a product.
Implementation: This is the interpretation of the need at hand into a computer based solution.
Testing: It entails ofconducting tests to ensure the software meets its requirements 
Deployment:This is the rolling out of the end product.
Maintenance:-This is improving and updating the software product.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology used a sequential approach to software development, that is, it followed one phase to another, while agile methodology prioritized flexibility, collaboration and quick to respond to change.
Scenarios:
Waterfall: Projects such as constructions or manufacturing that is industries that require thorough documentation.
Agile: Projects that evolve with time such as innovative product designs.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: is incharge of writing codes that run a system meant to offer solutions to certain needs.
A Quality Assurance Developer: is tasked to conduct test that are meant to check if the software developed is of quality.
Project Manager: Assigned to supervise the whole process of creating a software from development to delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments provide the environment required to develop a code that is writting, debugging and testing. Eg, Visual studio while Version Control Systems ensure codes are up to the level they are needed to be by allowing multiple developers to collaborate on the same project without altering each other work. Eg. Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines: To overcome this, Prioritize tasks, that is divide the project into manageable tasks and work on them based on their importance . Additionally, ensure to establish a communication grounds with stakeholders that can help in negotiatating deadlines when neccessary
Techinical Debt: Implemement a review process that will catch code related issues early. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: This is running checks in individual components of a software to ensure each unit code performs as expected. Its importance is, it ensures bugs are detected early.
Intergration testing: This involves verifying all components of the software developed work together as intended, that is each component is playing the role dedicated to it ensuring the main goal is achieved. Its importance is that it ensures a correct flow of data.
System testing: This is done to ensure all components of the software developed achieve the desired goal, that is it provide solutions as intended. Its importance is to validate the end-to-end functionality.
Acceptance testing: this conducted by end users to ensure the software meets their needs. Its importance is to ensure customer satisfaction.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering: This is the crafting of questions or directions that assist in interacting or guiding AI models to get clear information.
Importance: It helps in receiving relevant responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Prompt: "Tell me about the weather."
Improvement: " Tell me how Nairobi's weather is predicted to be tommorrow."
The first prompt is broad and an AI model while give its answer by describing what weather is, while the improved prompt will guide an AI model to specifically check Nairobi's weather giving the  user the intended feedback they were in quest for.
